## How to contribute

#### **Reporting a bug**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability**.

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/GLCharge/ocpi/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/GLCharge/ocpi/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue.

#### **Proposing changes or new features**

* Create a fork of the repository. Create a new pull request with the changes and a description of the changes.

#### **Fixing a bug**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
